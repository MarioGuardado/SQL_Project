# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The scope of the project is to create a database based on the raw data files of an online store selling a wide variety of consumer goods worldwide. 
The main goal of the project is to produce a database with relevant and clean data to ensure the accuracy and validity of the output of queries and operations performed on the database

## Process
#1 Acquisition of raw data (CSV) files.
#2 Creation of eCommerce database.
#3 Creation of database raw data tables: RawSessions, RawAnalytics, RawProducts, RawSales_Report, and RawSales_SKU.
#4 Import table data from raw data files.
#5 Creation of clean data tables from raw data tables: Sessions, Analytics, Products, Sales_Report, and Sales_SKU
#6 Formatting and cleaning of columns in clean data tables.
#7 Verification and validation of values in clean data tables.
#8 Obtaining accurate information to answer questions about the online store by sending the appropriate queries to the database.

## Results
#1 The United States is the store's main revenue source.
#2 "HOME" products are the most searched and purchased in the store.
#3 SPF-15 Slim & Slender Lip Balm is the top-selling product on the site.
#4 Leather Journal-Black and Android 17oz Stainless Steel Sport Bottle are top-selling products that are at risk of being out of stock for future purchases due to their current stock level and their restocking lead time.
#5 Bussiness is booming, with sales in the last quarter of operations increasing 765% from the first quarter of operations.
#6 Most of the visits to the website are the result of Organic Search thus that is a good target for advertising, however, most of the revenue is generated from Referral and Direct visits.

## Challenges 
#1 Data in raw data files is poorly formatted.
#2 Data between tables is inconsistent (Analytics includes 120,000 visits over three months whereas Sessions includes 15,000 visits over 12 months).

## Future Goals
#1 Cleaning Country and City columns to fix incorrect references like city=New York in Country=Canada.
#2 Creation of a Transactions
